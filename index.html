        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Christian Seaton, a senior studying Information Science at the University of South Florida. As I near the completion of my Bachelor's in Information Science, with a focus on Information Security, I'm passionate about cybersecurity, network defense, and ethical hacking.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and plan to take the AWS Cloud Computing Services exam soon. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in cryptography, network security, and vulnerability assessments. Iâ€™ve also gained hands-on experience through projects like security assessments and penetration testing.</p>
        <p>Alongside my studies, I am involved in civic engagement and leadership activities, further developing my collaboration and communication skills. I am excited about transitioning into the cybersecurity field after graduation, where I hope to contribute to protecting digital systems and mitigating cyber threats.</p>
